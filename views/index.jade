									|    I've been a client of Jessica's for the past three years and she is by far the BEST masseuse that I have ever worked with.  Jessica is in a class of her own, she gets to know you and your aliments and customizes her sessions to best fit your needs.  She is absolutely wonderful to work with and I am thankful that I found her when I moved to Denver.  Even if you currently have a masseuse that you are working with I would recommend at least one session with Jessica so that you can experience a truly therapeutic and healing massage.

									|    I finally found a regular massage therapist that I liked after trying a ton of them, and a few months later she went on maternity leave indefinitely: I was bummed... a friend recommended Jessica. And after the first massage, I was actually happy my old massage therapist had taken a leave because I ended up with a better one! Great rates, hours, location, pressure, technique... couldn't ask for more
